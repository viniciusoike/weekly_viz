# Data Visualization 

When I have some free time on my hands I like to explore some interesting topic. This project started as a spinoff of #TidyTuesday so I tried to keep the weekly updates and the tidyverse spirit.

Most of my visualizations are about economics, Brazil, and SÃ£o Paulo.

## Recessions in Brazil

* Since 1996, Brazil faced 5 recessions, including the most recent Covid-19 recession. Notably, the 2008-09 Financial Crisis had only a mild effect on the Brazilian economy: technically, the slump lasted only two quarters, and after 4 quarters GDP was already higher then pre-recession levels. The most severe recession in recent record was the 2014-16 recession. According to CODACE (Brazilian Business Cycle Dating Committee) it was the largest cumulative drop in %GDP since 1980 and it lasted 11 quarters. Even though the bust is technically over, the Brazilian economy is still **bellow** pre-2014 levels of activity.
* Note: despite current GDP being above pre-2020 levels, CODACE has yet to define when/if the Covid-19 recession ended.

## Growth in Brazil

* Brazil exhibited a strong growth pattern in the 1960s and 1970s. The combination of the two Oil Shocks, the restrictive monetary policy led by Volcker in the USA, and the overall increase in interest rates around the world caused a massive rise in foreign debt and helped fuel the hiper-inflation of the 1980s.
* During the 1980s, extremely restrictive measures were put into place to try to alleviate the BoP deficit and reduce foreign debt. Despite this, external pressure mounted after Mexico declared insolvency in 1982 and in 1987 Brazil also declared insolvency. Several economic plans were enacted in the following years, with catastrophic results. Only in 1994 the country managed to reduce inflation but at the cost of very high interest rates, and an artificially overvalued exchange rate. As a result, growth was very modest during the 1990s.
* The 2000s were a positive decade despite the 2008-09 International Financial Crisis. The 2010s, on the other hand, were more mixed, and was overall a Lost Decade.
